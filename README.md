Django Backend

Authentication: Use Django's built-in authentication system. Implement JWT or OAuth for more advanced authentication if needed.

Shop Page: Create a Django view and template to list products. Use Django's class-based views (CBVs) for reusable and manageable code.

Adding Products with Categories: Define models for Product and Category. Set up Django admin or a custom form to add products.

Displaying Products: Fetch products from the database and display them on the shop page. Use Django's template system to render product details.

Add to Cart: Implement a cart system using sessions or a database model. Allow users to add products to their cart and view them.

Checkout Page: Create a form for users to enter their shipping address and review their cart. Integrate with a payment gateway.

Search Product by Category: Add search functionality to filter products by category. Use Django's querysets to handle searches.

Remove or Update Cart Items: Provide options to modify the cart, such as removing items or changing quantities.

Shipping Address Form: Implement a form for users to enter their shipping details during checkout.

Payment Methods Integration: Use third-party services like Stripe or PayPal for payment processing. Implement UPI, debit/credit card, and banking methods if supported by the service.

Tracking Order Status: Allow users to track their orders. Implement order status updates and provide a way for users to view their order history.

React Frontend
Components: Create components for the shop page, product details, cart, and checkout.
State Management: Use state management libraries like Redux or Context API to manage cart state and user authentication.
API Integration: Connect your React frontend with the Django REST API for data fetching and submission.
Deployment
Django REST API with Postman: Use Postman to test your API endpoints. Ensure all endpoints return the expected responses and handle errors properly.

Server: Consider platforms like Heroku, AWS, or DigitalOcean for deployment.
Web Server: Use Apache2 or Nginx as the web server. Configure it to serve your Django application.
DNS Hosting with VPS Servers:

Set Up: Point your domain to your VPS server using DNS settings.
Configuration: Configure Apache2 or Nginx to serve your web app.
Adding SSL Certificates:

Let's Encrypt: Use Let's Encrypt for free SSL certificates.
